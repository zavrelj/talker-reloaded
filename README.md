# Talker | Reloaded
Sixteen years ago, I started working on my biggest project ever. It took me almost 5 years to get it to the final state before I left it untouched in my archive for almost 11 years.

It was a discussion server based on PHP and MySQL. In 2001 there was no Facebook. Mark needed 3 more years to launch it on February 2004.

I changed the name of this project many times. It started as TIRANN - CyberNet, later it was renamed to Talker and openTCZ. It was based on virtual rooms where users discussed specific topics. I also implemented a private messaging feature. Yes, something like Facebook Groups and Messenger we all know and use every day. Users had different rights based on their ranks. Ranks were assigned by activity and overall time spent inside the system.

So this is history, now about the future. I believe it's time to bring Talker back to life.

Not because it has any real chance against Facebook, but because it can work well for teaching purposes. I want to update it and make it work again. I don't even know how much effort it will need or if I will be able to resurrect it at all.

But here I am with this intriguing idea and I can't get it out of my head.

A lot has changed since the time when I started building this discussion server. There was no PHP framework, no Bootstrap, nothing. I started from scratch, I literally started with a blank new document.

I believe PHP frameworks can greatly improve developer's productivity, but if you want to really understand some technology, you should dig deep and take a look under the hood, behind the curtains.

That's why I want to breathe life into Talker and use it as a project for my upcoming course.

I also want to make myself accountable by publicly disclosing this goal. It will help me stay on tracks. Watch me closely to push me forward with this project!

I have just uploaded the latest modification from 2007 to GitHub. I didn't even try to run it yet. The code is in the state as I left it 10 years ago. I can almost feel the dust!

So, what's next?

I need to decide if I install Apache, PHP, and MySQL locally on my Windows machine or if I create a specific Vagrant VM for this project, or if I make a use of Docker
I will try to run the code and see what is working and where are some critical errors I will have to deal with
The first milestone is to have 2007 edition up and running.
Next, I will redesign the UI. I think I will use Bootstrap for that.
Finally, when everything is working in a presentable way, I will recreate it from scratch with the current versions of PHP and MySQL and record the whole process for the upcoming course.
To make give you an opportunity to shape the look and feel of this project, I will regularly ask you for your opinion on diferrent aspects.
