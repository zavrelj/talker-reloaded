# talker-reloaded
Remastered version of 15 years old discussion server based on LAMP

Fifteen years ago, I started working on my biggest project ever. It took me 5 years to get it to its final state before I left it untouched in my archive for almost 10 years.

Now it's time to bring it back to life. Not because it has any real chance against Facebook, but because it can work well for teaching purposes. I want to update it and make it work again with the latest PHP and MySQL. I don't even know how much work it will be or if I will be able to revive it or not.

But here I am with this intriguing idea and I can't get it out of my head.

A lot has changed since the time when I started building this discussion server. There was no Facebook, there was no PHP framework. I started from scratch, I literally started with a blank new document.

I believe PHP frameworks can greatly improve developer's productivity, but if you want to really understand some technology, you shouldn't be afraid to dig deep, to take a lot under the hood, behind the curtains.

That's why I want to breathe life into Talker and use it as a project for my upcoming course.

I also want to make myself accountable by publicly disclosing this. It will help me stay on tracks. Watch me closely to motivate me moving forward with this project.

I have just uploaded the latest modification from 2007 to GitHub. I didn't even try to run it yet. The code is in the final state where I left it some 10 years ago. I can almost feel the dust!

So, what's next?

1. I need to decide if I install Apache, PHP, and MySQL locally on my Windows machine or if I create specific Vagrant VM for this project, or if I make a use of Docker
2. I will try to run the code and see what is working and where are some critical errors I will have to deal with
3. The first milestone is running version, this is where my first steps will go.
4. Next, I will redesign the UI. I think I will use Bootstrap for that.
5. Finally, when it is working and looking in a presentable way, I will recreate it from scratch with the current version of PHP and MySQL and shoot the whole process for the upcoming course

Wish me luck!
